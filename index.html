  <p>The Nuovo Award is given at the Independent Games Festival (IGF), an annual event that takes place during the Game Developers Conference, one of the largest gatherings of the indie video game industry. The award is given to honor "abstract, shortform, and unconventional game development which advances the medium and the way we think about games". It was designed as a way for art games to compete with traditional indie games. In the thirteen years since its debut, 99 games have been nominated as finalists, while 79 games have been chosen as honorable mentions. Fifteen games have won the Nuovo Award, the first being the platformer Between (2009), developed by Jason Rohrer (pictured), while the most recent game to be awarded is the role-playing video game Betrayal at Club Low (2023), developed by Cosmo D.
